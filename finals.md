Question 4
- Answer B
- The digital divide describes the differences in access to computing devices and the Internet. Requiring job applicants to apply online serves only individuals who already have access to computing devices and the Internet. It does not help reduce the divide.

Question 5
- Answer A

This project would benefit from using a citizen science model for gathering photographs of plants from amateur photographers around the world.

Question 14
- Answer A
- The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.

Question 18
- Answer D
- The code segment initializes result to 2, then repeatedly multiplies result by 5 inside a loop. The loop iterates three times, so result is assigned the value of 2(53).

- Answer C
- Overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.

Question 46
- Answer C
- As any user has the ability to edit articles, there will be many opportunities for people with different perspectives to
- Answer D
- The online encyclopedia can be edited at any time, so it is easy to create or update articles as new information

Question 49
- Answer C
- The transformation is lossless because an encoded string can be restored to its original version. For example, Open quotation, percent, hash, underscore, hash, underscore, percent E, underscore, BEST, underscore, W, hash, H, close quotation can be restored to Open quotation, THIS, underscore, IS, underscore, THE, underscore, BEST, underscore, WISH, close quotation by replacing all instances of Open quotation, percent, close quotationwith Open quotation, T H, close quotation and by replacing all instances of Open quotation, hash, close quotation with Open quotation, I S, close quotation.

Question 1
- Answer B
- If the connections between U and V and between U and P were removed, then computer T and computer U can no longer communicate.

Question 2
- Answer B

Question 6
- Answer D
- This algorithm displays the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20. After 20 is displayed, x is incremented to 21. The value 21 is not displayed since it is a multiple of 3 and the algorithm terminates.
- Answer A
- This algorithm displays the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20. After 20 is displayed, the algorithm terminates.

Question 7
- Answer D
- The procedure initially sets result to 1 and j to 2. In the REPEAT UNTIL loop, result is first assigned the sum of result and j, or 1 + 2. The value of j is then increased to 3. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, result is increased by each successive value of j (3, 4, 5, etc.) until j exceeds n. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.

Question 13
- Answer C
- If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. 

Question 19
- Answer A
- Without knowing the individual assignment scores, the administrator is unable to determine any of the student’s individual scores other than the lowest score.

Question 27
- Answer B
- For a show to be counted, the value of genre must be "talk" and the value of day must be "Saturday" or "Sunday".

Question 33
- Answer A
- Basing the recommendation algorithm on data from a random sample of users will help ensure that the data gathered are more representative of all users of the application. Gathering data from a representative sample can help the developers avoid bias.

Question 39
- Answer B
- The total number of registered users appears to be increasing by about 0.5 million each year, so in year 12, the number of users can be approximated at 31.2 million (30.2 + 0.5 + 0.5).

Question 43

Question 47
- Answer D
- This code segment sets bonus to 0 when score < 50, sets bonus to score * 10 when score > 100, and sets bonus to score when 100 ≥ score ≥ 50.
- Answer A
- This code segment sets bonus to score * 10 when score > 100, sets bonus to score when 100 ≥ score ≥ 50, and sets bonus to 0 when score < 50.

Question 49
- Answer B
- A user can see a map of other people in the area who may not be on the user’s contact list.

Question 50
- Answer A
- The variable first is initially assigned the value 100 and the variable second is initially assigned the value 200. Next, temp is assigned the value of first, which is 100. Next, second is assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Last, first is assigned the value of second, which is 100. After execution, both first and second have the value 100.

Question 2
- Answer B
- An incorrect trial count occurs because there are two calls to RANDOM for each iteration of the loop instead of one. By replacing line 9 with an ELSE statement, the code segment will increment xCount approximately 25% of the time and will increment yCount otherwise.

Question 3
- Answer B
- Since y is initially negative, the loop condition count ≥ y is initially true, so the body of the loop is never executed and 0 is returned.
- Answer D
- Since y is initially negative, the loop condition count ≥ y is initially true, so the body of the loop is never executed and 0 is returned.

Question 6
- Answer C
- The information to be displayed comes from both databases. The animal name can be used search the first database to find the classification, skin type, and thermoregulation information. The animal name can be used search the second database to find the lifestyle, average life span, and top speed information.

Question 10
- Answer C
- The loop should iterate once for each multiple of 5 from start to end. The number of multiples of 5 from start to end is given by Open parenthesis, open parenthesis, end minus start, close parenthesis, divided by 5, close parenthesis, plus 1. For the example given, Open parenthesis, open parenthesis, end minus start, close parenthesis, divided by 5, close parenthesis, plus 1evaluates to 4.

Question 13
- Answer C
- Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid.

Question 15
- Answer C
- The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the
corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.

Question 19
- Answer D
- In this code segment, three coin flips are simulated, where one result is represented by 1 and the other result is represented by 0. The player wins when the sum of these is 0 or 3, indicating all heads or all tails.

Question 35
- Answer C
- If devices B and F fail, then devices E, G, and H will become isolated from devices A, C, D, and I. Therefore, device A will be unable to communicate with device G.

Question 38
- Answer A
- This code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.
