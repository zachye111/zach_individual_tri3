## Zachary Ye Individual Notes Actions

### 5.1 Actions

- Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
- One benefit of computing is contactless communication, where in a world of disease and bodily virus's, you can communicate without actually being in person. A con of computing is digital virus's, where some individuals are able to steal your information. Another benifit of computing is storage of information, whether it be documents or videos. This allows people to store thousands of files without taking up much physical space. A downfall of computing is environmental impact, as the production of parts as well as use of electricity is known to be harmful for the Earth. A third benefit of computing is the ability to automate tasks, specifically tasks that take long periods of time but not much difficulty involved. A last con of computing is health issues, many people develop eye issues from staring at screens. Many other physical problems are connected to the use of computers and phones.
- Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- Many algorithms are designed to take advantage of this dopamine response feedback. I have personally experienced this, as apps like tik tok can becoming pretty addicting due to the dopamine response. Because of this, I definitly believed that this is real. These "addictions" can cut into studying time and really impact my grades and focus. 

### 5.2 Actions

- How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- Someone can empower themself in a digital world by utilizing the internet to help others in need. Technology offers people never before had oppurtunities. It allows someone not only to help people across the globe, but help them without having to travel anywhere. It can be very empowering to help those in need. 
- How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- An example of someone not being empowered (having to do with the digital world) is not being able to use a computer as well as other students. To resolve this issue, it would help to help them understand, and support there needs in becoming more knowledable. 
- Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Red tape blocking is defined as sets of rules and regulations that hold people back. Some barriers a Del Norte that this is an example of is the blocking of certain sites on the Del Norte website, which does not allow free roaming of the internet. An example of red tape blocking elsewhere is the lack of internet access in certain countries, which doesn't allow the students and workers the same oppurtunities as more fortunate individuals. 

### 5.3 Actions

- Watch the video... HP computers are racist
- Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
- No, I don't believe the owner thought it was intentional, as they knew it was a programming mistake. 
- If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
- I think that the owner doesn't think it was intentional because a big company like HP would not create a racist program. 
- How do you think this happened?
- I think this happened because the people who created and tested the program didn't have darker skin tones, so this created a bias towards lighter skin tones. 
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
- This can be harmful, as some people who need to use the program may no be able to. As stated before, I do not think that the program intended to be harmful. 
- Should it be corrected?
- Yes, the program should be corrected so everyone is able to use it. 
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
- To produce a better outcome, someone should utilize crowdsourcing to eliminate any bias in the program.

### 5.4 Actions

- CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- Creating an app where it shows the best way to execute a specific assignment. This would use crowdsource because it can take into account the opinions of all students, so there is no bias towards the person who made it.
- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
- Our final project is a AP class page. This could be made better with crowdsourcing because it can take into account the opinions of multiple students on a specific class. This would improve our project because it will elminate bias, as the person who made the page may be bias towards a class. 

### 5.5 Actions
- When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
- Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
- The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you've created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain.
- Open Source MIT License
- This license in friendly to someone like Qualcomm! This allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions.
- Open Source GPL License
- The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions.
- Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
- I chose a GPL-3.0 liscense, which is a public liscense. I chose this so it can be viewed and used by the general public, and it is easy and understandable. I can potentially gain revenue using this liscense as well. 

### 5.6 Actions
- Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
- Examples of PII that I have seen in CSP are things like full names and email adresses. 
- What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
- In my opinion, PII can be a very dangerous thing. In the digital age, the exposure of PII can lead to many unsafe things.
- Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
- Good passwords are random, and cannot be guessed. Bad passwords are things like birthdays or names, these things can be guessed easily. Something that can be used to assist authentication is 2-step.
- Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
- Symmetric encryption is when something is shared amongst a group of people who need to verify. Asymmetric encryption is when a pair of private and public keys are used. 
- Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
- In deployment, the code used that is pushed from are accounts are behind password and email encryption. 
- Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
- A phishing scheme that I have learned about the hard way is email phisihing. Another pishing scheme is text phishing.
