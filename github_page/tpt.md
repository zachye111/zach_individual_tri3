- Harmful- broken tv’s injuries
- Not every effect can be anticipated

- Casino effect- leads to overpaying
- Considered gambling
- Innovations can be used in harmful ways
- Innovators cannot think of all the ways there creations can be used

### 5.2 Notes

- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic geographic, or demographic characteristics
- Digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
- Digital divide raises issues of equality, access, and influence, both globally and locally
- Digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments.

### 5.3 Notes

- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases, because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithm used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embed at all levels of software development
- Can either be intentional or unintentional 

### 5.4 Notes

- Public Data Sets
- Kaggle
- Courses in visualizations, TensorFlow, AI, Machine learning, and more.
- Competitions- cash prizes, swag, props
- Notebooks- code, data, notes
- Google Public Data Sets
- Free for the 1st Terabyte
- All-in-one package that uses BigQuery- Library and toolset that for SQL
- Data.gov
- US Government data
- Agriculture, energy, water, health
- Your Local Government
- Keeps them accountable
- Help find solutions and trends in your area
- IOC-1.E.1
- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results

- Distributed Computing
- Donate spare computing power to help calculations
- Folding@Home - Stanford University
- Protein Folding
- BOINC - University of California, Berkeley
- Variety of Projects
- Mathematics
- Astrophysics
- Climate
- Minecraft@Home
- Etc.
- IOC-1.E.2
- Science has been affected by using distributed and “Citizen Science” to solve scientific problems.

- IOC-1.E.3
- Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own contributing devices.

- IOC-1.E.5
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing 

- Innovations made possible with crowdsourcing  

- Spotify
- Collaborative playlists
- Algorithm
- Metadata Write-in
- Crowdfunding
- Kickstarter
- IndieGoGo
- Etc.
- Blockchain
- Cryptocurrency
- Other tokens- Concert Tickets
- IOC-1.E.4
- Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet.
- IOC-1.E.6
- Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting business or social causes with funding 

### 5.5 Notes 

- Intellectual Property
- Intellectual property (IP): a work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights
- Easy to access
- Copyright
- Copyright protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give them your permission
- Plagiarism: Presenting material as your own
- Legal ways to use materials created by someone else:
- Creative commons
- Open source
- Open access
- Creative Commons
- Creative commons provides free licenses that you can use to tell others hope you want them to use your creations.
- It clearly tells others what they can and can not do with your IP
- Open Source and Open Access
- Open source: programs made freely available for anyone to use and may b e redistributed and modified
- Open Access: Online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
- Always give credit

- Legal and Ethical Concerns
- Digital Didie: Unequal distribution of access to technology

### 5.6 Notes
- Personally Identifiable Information
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Information specific to an individual 
- SSN
- Age
- Race
- Phone number
- Date of birth
- Email address
- Mailing address
- Medical information
- Credit card information
- Can be used to steal someone else's information
- Search engines maintain a history of what you search
- Search history is used to suggest other websites you may like or for targeted marketing
- Location can be collected
- Can enhance a user’s online experience
- Can exploit privacy and other protections ignored
- Information placed online can be used in ways that were not intended and that may have a harmful impact
- Authentication
- Authentication measure protect devices and information from unauthorized access
- Authentication measures:
- Strong password
- Multi-factor authentication
- Strong Password
- Creating strong passwords
- 10 or more characters
- Contains a symbol
- Contains a number
- Contains a lowercase and uppercase letter
- Virus and Malware
- Virus: copy themselves and gain access to systems that they are not supposed to be allowed in
- Malware: intended to damage a computer system or take particle control over its operation
- Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attaching itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment
- Virus scans can help to prevent malicious code from getting into and affecting your system
- Encryption and Decryption
- Once legitimate access to a system is gained, it is important to ensure data sent to and from the system remains uncompromised
- Encryption: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access 
- Symmetric encryption
- One key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data
- Ex: Caesar Cipher
- Asymmetric encryption
- Public key encryption: uses two keys 
- A public key for encrypting
- A private key for decrypting
- Sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message
- Receiver’s private key IS required to decrypt the message
- Description: the process of decoding data
- Digital Certificates
- Certificate authorities issue digit certificates that validate the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model
- Importance of the internet
- The internet is an integral part of our lives
- Risk to Personal Safety
- Phishing: an attempt to trick a user into providing personal information, like your usernames and passwords, account numbers, or social security numbers
- Often look like they're from a company you know and trust:
- Your bank
- Credit Card company
- Social networking site
- Video streaming service
- Online Store
- They trick you into clicking a link or opening an attachment
- Clicking a link or opening an attachment in a phishing email will cause unexpected harm:
- Virus installed on your computer
- Spoofed baking website
- Keylogger installed	
- Records every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidential information	
- Rogue access point: a wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks
