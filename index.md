## Zachary Ye Individual Notes and Actions (Test Prep Study)

These are my notes for trimester 3 of Computer Science Principles.

### 5.1 Notes

- Video 1
- The Wii and Iphone have accelerometers in them
- Accelerometers
- Chip that detects acceleration
- First used in automobiles
- Detects acceleration
- Quadcopter (brain) also has accelerometer
- Detects speed and direction
- The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Multirotor (quadcopter)
- Benefits- deliveries, finding lost people
- Harmful- flying unregulated zones
- Wii controller
- Benefit- gets people active video games
- Harmful- broken tv’s injuries
- Not every effect can be anticipated
- 3D Printers
- Open source software for computer and printer
- In schools and homes
- Shoes and Jewelry
- Themselves
- People create computing innovations
- Innovations increase creativity in other fields
- Video 2
- The internet was originally designed for scientists
- Now, many people use internet more than they sleep
- Dopamine feedback loops
- When you get likes and comments, it makes you happy
- Makes you seek this
- Leads to depression, anxiety, 
- Tik-Tok PSA
- Innovations can be used in unintended ways
- Microtransactions
- Free games and apps
- Cosmetics, paywall functionality
- Pay to get virtual currency
- Casino effect- leads to overpaying
- Considered gambling
- Innovations can be used in harmful ways
- Innovators cannot think of all the ways there creations can be used

### 5.1 Actions

- Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
- One benefit of computing is contactless communication, where in a world of disease and bodily virus's, you can communicate without actually being in person. A con of computing is digital virus's, where some individuals are able to steal your information. Another benifit of computing is storage of information, whether it be documents or videos. This allows people to store thousands of files without taking up much physical space. A downfall of computing is environmental impact, as the production of parts as well as use of electricity is known to be harmful for the Earth. A third benefit of computing is the ability to automate tasks, specifically tasks that take long periods of time but not much difficulty involved. A last con of computing is health issues, many people develop eye issues from staring at screens. Many other physical problems are connected to the use of computers and phones.
- Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- Many algorithms are designed to take advantage of this dopamine response feedback. I have personally experienced this, as apps like tik tok can becoming pretty addicting due to the dopamine response. Because of this, I definitly believed that this is real. These "addictions" can cut into studying time and really impact my grades and focus. 

### 5.2 Notes

- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic geographic, or demographic characteristics
- Digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
- Digital divide raises issues of equality, access, and influence, both globally and locally
- Digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments.

### 5.2 Actions

- How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- Someone can empower themself in a digital world by utilizing the internet to help others in need. Technology offers people never before had oppurtunities. It allows someone not only to help people across the globe, but help them without having to travel anywhere. It can be very empowering to help those in need. 
- How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- 
- Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
